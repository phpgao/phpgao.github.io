![Olivia Broadfield - Say][3]

歌词：

There is something I should say
There is something I should tell you
There is nothing in my way
But I have to get it out of me
Can we stay here just a little bit longer please
Can you say things just to offer me some release
No one ever sees the highs
No one ever gets the best of me
No one sees me through your eyes
They are always second guessing me
Can we stay here just a little bit longer please
Can you say things just to offer me some release
Can we stay here just a little bit longer please
Can you say things just to offer me some release

有一些话我必须说
有些事情我想对你说
我没有什么不顺的
但是我必须把它说出来
我们能不能在这里多呆一会儿
你可以说一些宽慰我的话吗
没人见过最高的处
没人得到过最好的我
没人想你那样看着我

翻译的不好啊。。。
