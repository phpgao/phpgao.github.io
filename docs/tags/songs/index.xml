这首歌是白日梦想家的一段插曲，MV也很出色。这个乐队的歌曾经被APPLE作为广告曲。
歌词讲了一个有趣的故事，让人脑洞大开啊，真想和他们最后一起LALALA。
Jumping up and down the floor, my head is an animal. And once there was an animal, it had a son that mowed the lawn. The son was an ok guy, he had a pet dragonfly The dragonfly it ran away but it came back with a story to say. Her dirty paws and furry coat, she ran down the forest slope.</description>

有些时候不想说话，比如这会儿。
歌词：
There is something I should say There is something I should tell you There is nothing in my way But I have to get it out of me Can we stay here just a little bit longer please Can you say things just to offer me some release No one ever sees the highs No one ever gets the best of me No one sees me through your eyes They are always second guessing me Can we stay here just a little bit longer please Can you say things just to offer me some release Can we stay here just a little bit longer please Can you say things just to offer me some release</description>
